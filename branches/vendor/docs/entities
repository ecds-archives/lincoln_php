To create an image entities file easily.

1. In emacs, run a shell command (Using Esc + !) 
   ls /path to/images 
   and copy the output into a new emacs file. 

2.In the new emacs file, use the Replace regular expression command. 
For example, to replace each of the following paths:
/chaucer/data/lincoln/images/yard14.jpg
Use,
M-x replace-regexp. 
^/chaucer/data/lincoln/images/\(.*\).jpg$
****** The ^ indicates that matching should start at the beginning of the line
  and $ that it should continue till the end. \ is used to identify the (
  symbol. The (.*) is used to grep or isolate one portion of the path or
  expression - the file name before the extension in this case which can be
  referred to later by \1 or \no. if there are additional expressions
  isolated.**************
Replace with:
<!ENTITY \1 SYSTEM "chaucer/data/lincoln/images/\1.jpg" NDATA jpg>

This takes each original path specification and replaces it with the above
expression using the original filename for each.
