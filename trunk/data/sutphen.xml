               <p pn="5">THIS world is a world of vicissitude. The joys of to-day and the
tears of to-morrow are life's constant interchanges. Of this truth we
have had sad experience as a people within the last few hours. But
yesterday our hearts were bounding with glee, to-day our hearts are
breaking with grief. But yesterday our faces were brightened with
gladness, to-day they are darkened with sadness. But yesterday our
houses were decked in triumph, to-day they are draped in trouble. But
yesterday our bells rang merry paeans, to-day they toll mournful
dirges. But yesterday our banners, full high advanced, floated gayly,
to-day they fall gloomily at half-mast. A funeral pall has suddenly
settled upon city and country, like that which shrouded Egypt on the
memorable night of the universal slaughter of her first-born--from the
first-born of Pharaoh on the throne, to the first-born of the

captive in the dungeon, and the first-born of the cattle in the
stall. In one short hour silence and sorrow, darkness and distress,
weeping and wailing, have supplanted light and life, happiness and
hope, elation and exultation, in the hamlets, and homes, and hearts
throughout the land.</p>
               <p pn="6">What has so suddenly dashed our cup of joy, changed our feastings
into fastings, our congratulations into commiserations? The answer is
too well known to you. "Death is come into our windows, and is entered
into our palaces." "The beauty of Israel is slain upon the high
places: the mighty is fallen." The President of the United States,
most suddenly and unexpectedly, most cowardly and cruelly, has been
cut down by the hand of an assassin in human form.</p>
               <p pn="6">And it is no wonder that the death of the nation's Chief Magistrate
sends a tide of sorrow over the land, and that houses hitherto
uninvaded by the desolations of this desolating war, are now filled
with grief. The loss of the loved head of a family, makes many
mourners,--the loss of the loved head of a church more--the loss of
the loved head of a State still more; but, more than all, the loss of
the loved head of a nation.</p>
               <p pn="6">But it is not simply because a respected and regarded Chief
Magistrate is so suddenly dashed from the high place of power, that
the people mourn. This heavy blow we have felt once and again
before. Two Pre-

sidents have been removed while still in office, since the foundation
of the Republic. General William Henry Harrison was called away after
a month's service; General Zachary Taylor, after a little more than a
year's. Both these removals were the occasion of wide-spread sorrow,
and especially that of the former, "in whose thoughts, in death as in
life, the happiness of his country was uppermost." But without aught
of disrespect or injustice to either of these worthy dead, it may
safely be said, this people mourns to-day as never before. And the
reason is, that not only the head, but the HOPE of the nation is
destroyed.</p>
               <p pn="7">ABRAHAM LINCOLN was the human hope of the country. This is too
evident to be questioned. The man who disputes it, shows either
pitiable ignorance, or still more pitiable prejudice. His original
nomination to the Presidency, intimated that in him were thought, by a
large portion of the representative men of the nation, to lie the
qualities needed for the safe conduct of the already troubled affairs
of State, while his subsequent election indicated that their judgment
was confirmed by the majority of the people. But especially his
renomination, almost by acclamation, and his reelection by a vote so
overwhelming as to be almost unprecedented, were evidence that on him,
above all his countrymen, rested the popular confidence. The painful
solicitude, also, which filled our hearts, on the occasion of his
first and second inauguration, argues that to him

all eyes were looking. And if further testimony to this point were
needed, we might find it in the anxiety, and I may almost say alarm,
which was experienced when the recent infirmity of his health was
reported, and further when his departure for the front was heralded,
and still further when his visit to the rebel capital was
telegraphed. And the sensible relief of the people when it was lately
learned that he had safely returned to Washington, and the general
protest against the future exposure of a life felt to be so important
to the well being, if not also to the being of the nation, evince that
from him was the expectation of the country. The prayers, too, for his
preservation, which have ascended continually since his first
investiture with the robes of office, and with increased fervor and
frequency since his second, show that to him, above all others of our
leading men, we were looking for a happy termination of our
troubles. Truly, from the beginning of our peril, without
interruption, and without change, except by way of increase, the
confidence of the country has centred in ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>
               <p pn="8">And the reasons why our trust so largely reposed in him are
obvious. One undoubtedly was his <hi rend="italic">successful conduct of
our affairs during the four years of difficulty recently
ended</hi>. For, recall the troubles that beset him at the time of his
entrance upon office. The capital swarmed with traitors, and approach
to it was barred by armed assassins lurking for his life. Secretly

was he hurried at the dead hour of night, through the bullets and
bowie knives of his would-be murderers, to Washington. Protected by
hastily summoned detachments of soldiery, he was safely inducted into
power. And then, how many and great the difficulties that surrounded
him. The Southern country plotting, perfecting, and performing
treason; the Northern arsenals stripped of munitions of war, the navy
scattered to the four quarters of the globe, the treasury bankrupt;
truly, all seemed lost, and lost beyond recovery. And yet, how bravely
did he breast the billows of destruction that beat around him. How
soon were troops hurried to the front, ships of wood and iron
extemporized, and armed rebellion met by arms. And how admirably, in
spite of many dark disasters, in which he stood dauntless among the
daunted, have our loyal legions swept state after state, until now
organized resistance to the Government has almost vanished. Thanks to
God, Abraham Lincoln was permitted to see the beginning of the end, if
not the end itself, and himself to telegraph the downfall of the
stronghold of the rebellion and himself to enter it amid the wild
demonstrations of delight of its long dragooned but now delivered
people. Thanks to God, that he was permitted to see the surrender of
the army, in which treason specially trusted and boasted, and to order
the suspension of conscription throughout the land.  Thanks to God, he
was permitted to

lead the people he loved to the verge of the promised land, and
himself to behold it, if not to enter it. Truly, as, in token of
vindicated federal authority throughout the land, the national banner
ascended the staff, from which, just four years before, it had been
lowered in Charleston harbor, he might have said--"Lord, now, lettest
thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy
salvation."</p>
               <p pn="10">And not only the eminent success with which he conducted the
affairs of the nation, but also <hi rend="italic">the eminent
qualities</hi> which he manifestly possessed, led the people to repose
their confidence in him. Time will permit me only baldly to enumerate
the more prominent of these. One that stands out conspicuously, was
his wisdom. President Lincoln was not, in the ordinary acceptation of
the phrase, a man of learning.  He made no pretension to high literary
accomplishments. Nor was he an expert in the dark sinuosities of
diplomacy. Neither has he been regarded as specially proficient in
statesmanship, or deeply versed in constitutional law. But if he had
read little, he had thought much. If he possessed small learning, he
possessed great wisdom. Especially wonderful, was his insight into
human nature. And he proved his sagacity in the men he called to be
his counsellors; as also in the measures he originated, perfected, and
executed. The manner, too, in which he moderated the bitter passions
of opposing partisans, and mediated between

the warring factions of friendly supporters, and educated the
slow-moving masses up to the desire and the determination, of the
perpetuity of the Union, and the universal prevalence of liberty,
evidence his eminent skill. His original, unique, aphoristic state
papers, also, which, sent on their mission at just the opportune
moment, so wonderfully harmonized sentiment and action in our midst,
will be respected and regarded by an admiring posterity, as eminently
products and paragons of wisdom. No wonder that an insight so keen,
commanded the confidence of the country.</p>
               <p pn="11">Another distinguishing quality of the late President, and which
made him justly the hope of the nation, was his singular <hi rend="italic">honesty</hi>. That he was eminently an honest man, may be
asserted in any presence, without the fear of successful
contradiction. In all the lying lampoons invented against him during
the heat of his first and second presidential campaigns, I do not
remember to have seen any question even, of his uprightness. Though
engaged the greater part of his life in a profession easily perverted
to dishonesty, all the testimonies that have ever reached my eyes and
ears, unite in declaring him to have been upright, if not to a fault,
at least to his loss. Instance's could be produced, in which he
discouraged litigation on the part of his clients, at the expense of
profitable employment. Truly, if an honest man is the noblest work of
God, the dispassionate judgment of mankind will

enroll Abraham Lincoln among the princes of the race.</p>
               <p pn="12">And if he had honesty as a citizen, he had <hi rend="italic">integrity</hi> as a ruler. In all his official acts he
showed most praiseworthy disinterestedness. I am not aware that he has
been charged with corruption even by his most irresponsible
detractors. And if such accusations have been preferred, I am sure
they have not been accredited by any, at all acquainted with his
character and conduct. We can almost as well conceive of his plunging
a dagger into the nation's heart, as trafficking in the nation's
necessities. And as he most rigidly avoided all bribes, so he ever
shunned private partialities and party cabals. Whatever may be imputed
to others high in position, it cannot be charged against President
Lincoln, that he was influenced in the performance of the duties of
his office, by considerations either of person, pelf, or power. No man
among his illustrious predecessors, directed the affairs of state with
less regard to self, and his name will live in history as that of a
man of unimpeachable integrity. No marvel that from such a character
the country derived high expectation.</p>
               <p pn="12">Another eminent quality of the lamented dead, which made him so
largely the nation's delight and dependence, was his broad-hearted <hi rend="italic">benevolence</hi>.  Indeed, he was by common consent kind

ing tenderness, we owe not indirectly, our sore bereavement. He seemed
incapable of revenge or hatred, or even suspicion. Look at the lenity
he has exhibited towards treason. Verily, the leaders of this most
atrocious rebellion, at whose instigation this crime, unprecedented in
our history, has been perpetrated, could not possibly have suffered a
larger loss, than the life of Abraham Lincoln. Never did fiendish
malignity more signally overreach itself, than in this dire deed. He,
who of all men high in authority, was disposed to temper mercy with
justice in the treatment of rebels, and whose clemency had proceeded
so far as to fill with fears the hearts of patriots, has been by their
own suicidal hands, wrested from them. Not only recently, but
constantly, throughout the war, he has manifested a spirit of the
utmost possible kindness. At the peril of popularity with his own
party, at the risk of renomination for his high position he proposed a
plan of reconstruction most gracious to the revolted sections of the
country. And in the famous interview which he condescended to hold
with the self-appointed commissioners of the rebel authorities, he
intimated his readiness to exercise all the leniency, which fidelity
to the interests intrusted to him would allow. Yea more, the very last
speech he delivered was a plea for his liberal plan of state, instead
of territorial, reconstruction. Rarely, if ever, did a human heart
beat with purer, kindlier impulses; and no won-

der that the nation loved him, and looked to him, as to no other
functionary, civil or military, for the reduction of the rebellion of
Southern hearts, as well as the rebellion of Southern hands.</p>
               <p pn="14">The only other prominent characteristic of President Lincoln which
I can, on the present occasion, notice, and which made him the hope of
the country, was his <hi rend="italic">dependence on Almighty
God</hi>. I do not mean positively to assert that he was a man of
piety; although from testimony, direct and indirect, I have, months
since, been led to believe him to be a Christian. Such, too, it is
asserted on evidence which cannot be questioned, was his own hope. In
answer to the inquiry, propounded by a clergyman on behalf of himself
and others, whether he loved the Lord Jesus Christ, he is reported to
have replied--"I trust I can say I do;" and to have dated his saving
change from the solemn scene of the consecration of the National
Cemetery at Gettysburg. And while my heart bleeds most at the thought
that he should have received the fatal blow within the walls of a
theatre, yet when I remember that he was drawn thither reluctantly,
and from his characteristic kindly desire to mitigate the
disappointment of the crowd collected in promise of the presence of
the absent Lieutenant-General, I find it not impossible to think of
him among the blood-bought throng of martyrs--himself a martyr in one
of the holiest causes that ever demanded the sacrifice of

human life. But whether he was a possessor of piety or not, he was
unquestionably a believer in prayer. Indeed, it is asserted that it
was his custom to spend an early hour each morning in private
devotion. And in consistency with, and corroboration of this
testimony, is the value he undoubtedly attached to the supplications
of God's people. Who has forgotten the remarkable request he made of
his fellow-citizens of Springfield, on leaving them for his perilous
mission--"Pray for me?" And what evident satisfaction and support did
he derive from the assurances, from time to time made to him, of his
interest in the prayers of the church. Moreover, how frequently did he
summon the nation to supplication, and how frequently acknowledge the
presiding providence of God. In his very last speech, he reminded his
hearers of the hand of the Lord in the late signal victories
vouchsafed to our arms and gave notice of the appointment of a day of
Thanksgiving therefor. Truly, it was natural that a Christian people
should repose their confidence in one who reposed his confidence in
God. And we can well understand how the removal of one, who to this
eminence in faith, added eminence in goodness, in integrity, in
honesty, in wisdom, and in experience of the conduct of troubled
affairs of state, was the destruction of the nation's hope. No wonder
that at this seemingly irreparable loss, lion-hearted men, as well as
timid-hearted women, are moved to fears, as well as melted

themselves on all faces throughout the land.</p>
               <p pn="16">But should we yield to discouragement and despair, because of this
dark dispensation? NO, NO, NO. "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and
why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet
praise him, who is the health of my countenance and my God." Though
the human arm on which we fondly leaned has been paralyzed in death,
the God who gave us ABRAHAM LINCOLN still lives. That God who has led
us thus far through our Red Sea of blood, still reigns secure and
supreme on the throne of the universe, doing his will in the armies of
heaven and among the inhabitants of earth. And let us remember that it
is He who has destroyed the nation's hope. Not chance, not fatality,
not the malignity even of the miserable murderer, on whose memory will
fall the maledictions of mankind, and who will be inevitably doomed to
an immortality of infamy: but God has done this deed. And let us
believe that he has dealt with us in mercy. Let us rest confident that
there is light in this dark dispensation.</p>

ness of his people into gladness. How perplexing the providence which
removed Moses, the distinguished leader and lawgiver of Israel, just
as the chosen people were about to enter the land of promise, and
encounter the many and mighty tribes of the Canaanites, intrenched in
cities walled to heaven. And yet the Lord raised up one fully equal to
the emergency, who led the sacred hosts across the Jordan, and from
victory to victory, till the whole land was possessed. And so, though
our beloved President, after leading an afflicted people through the
wilderness of war to the border of the promised land of peace, has
been cut down, God is able and willing to endow his successor with the
qualities needed to give them entrance into the long-desired Canaan of
rest. Yea, more. Was not the President's death necessary to the
nation's life? Were we not leaning upon an arm of flesh, forgetful of
the ever-living God, indulging--though in a different form--the very
sin of idolatry which brought upon us the woes through which we have
passed? Was his removal not necessary to turn the eyes of the people
upwards to the everlasting hills, whence alone all help must come?
Could God have consummated our salvation from our pains and perils in
consistency with his glory and our good, without breaking this strong
staff upon which we were leaning? If he had been spared to complete
our deliverance, would not much of the glory due to the Creator have
been ac

corded to the creature; and. has not the Most High, in destroying our
human hope, answered the prayers which from the beginning the church
has offered, that He would so signally interpose for our rescue, that
all should acknowledge his agency and ascribe to him the praise due
his great name? Do we not feel that now we are cast upon the Lord; and
are we not prepared to say, when brought out of our straits into a
large and wealthy place, "Behold what God hath wrought!"</p>
               <p pn="18">Besides, is it not possible that the overflowing love of our late
President would have made concessions to rebels, calculated to imperil
the peace and safety of the nation, and to tarnish the fair fame with
which he will now descend to posterity? Is it not probable that the
very humane policy he desired so much to inaugurate, would have proved
prejudicial to the perpetuity of union and liberty, and that it was
necessary that one, fresh from hand-to-hand grapple with treason, and
familiar with its fiendish spirit, should be placed in power, so to
punish rebellion, that it should never again raise its accursed head
in the land? Is it not reasonable to suppose that God, having shielded
the life of our loved President from the long meditated blow of his
murderer, until he had finished the particular work for which he was
fitted, until he had seen the banner of the Union elevated in triumph
over both the cradle and the capital of secession, took him up to the
higher duties and delights of the heavenly world,

that one educated among the Southern people, well acquainted with
their peculiar prejudices, and already largely experienced in the work
of reconstruction, might accomplish this delicate and difficult task?
I trust, I believe, it is so. I hear the Lord speaking to the present
incumbent of the Presidential chair as he did to Joshua--"Moses my
servant, is dead; now, therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, thou and
all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the
children of Israel. There shall not any man be able to stand before
thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with
thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and of good
courage; for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them."</p>
               <p pn="19">There is then no reason for despair, or despondency, or even
discouragement, because of this seemingly dark dispensation. On this
black cloud we may already behold the rainbow of promise. Let us only
persevere in "loosing the bands of wickedness, in undoing heavy
burdens, letting the oppressed go free, in breaking every yoke, in
feeding the hungry and covering the naked,"and then, as God is true,
"our light shall break forth as the morning, and our health shall
spring forth speedily, and our righteousness shall go before us, and
the glory of the Lord shall be our rereward."</p>
