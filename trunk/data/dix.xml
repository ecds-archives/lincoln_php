            <p pn="3">UPON receiving the news of the assassination of the
President, the Vestry assembled, on the call of the Rector of the
Parish, at 3 o'clock, P. M., on Saturday, April 15th, and adopted,
unanimously, the following preamble and resolutions:-</p>
            <p pn="3">WHEREAS, on the evening of the 14th day of April, 1865,
being Good Friday, by an assassin as yet unknown, the venerated and
beloved President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was suddenly
assaulted and slain; and whereas the announcement of that appalling
crime has just been made to this community, filling all hearts with a
grief, astonishment, and indignation which cannot be described; and
whereas this Vestry has been called together by the Rector, to take
such action as in their judgment may seem fit and becoming;
therefore,-</p>
            <p pn="3">
               <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That this Vestry, as sharers
in the common distress and affliction, unite in the public lamentation
over the untimely death of the honored Chief Magistrate of the Union,
and shocked beyond measure at the intelligence which has just been
received, remain without words adequate to express their sorrow.</p>
            <p pn="3">
               <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we recognize in this
calamitous event one of those visitations, permitted by Almighty God,
before which</p>

            <p pn="4">a nation can but bow in silence and awe, with the prayer that they
may be overruled for the good of our country.</p>
            <p pn="4">
               <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That while we regard the act
by which our beloved country has thus been, through indescribable
malice and fury, plunged into the deepest addiction, as one of those
crimes of which no language can adequately paint the atrocity, of
which the history of Europe has not for many centuries furnished a
parallel, of which our own history has thus far furnished no example,
and than which no history furnishes a more detestable and infamous act
to the view, we cannot but hold it to have been dictated by the spirit
which, from the commencement of our national troubles, has sympathized
with the enemies of the public peace, and aided and abetted the
rebellion, now, as we trust, subdued; a spirit whose tendencies and
essential character had previously been manifested in the July riots
in this city, in 1863, in the attempt to destroy this city by
incendiarism, in November last, and in the systematic outrages
inflicted on our captured soldiers in the prisons of the South.</p>
            <p pn="4">
               <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That this Vestry hereby
record their tribute of respect to the memory of the late President
with profound sorrow for his loss, recognizing in him a singleness of
purpose, an honesty of intention, an ardent patriotism, a fidelity to
duty, and a growing mastery of the circumstances of his position,
which enabled him, under Providence, to fulfil and bring to successful
completion a work almost unprecedented for difficulty; and that in his
removal, at the moment in which the labors of his last four years had
culminated in the triumph of the national authority and the evident
approach of the blessings of peace, we see the completion of a career
which the nation will ever look back to with thankfulness, and hold in
affectionate and tender remembrance.</p>
            <p pn="4">
               <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the Rector be requested
to take order that the churches of this parish be draped in mourning,
in token of our sympathy with the distress and anguish which have been
caused throughout the length and breadth of the land</p>

recommendation of the National Government, funeral solemnities were
held, at 12 o'clock meridian, throughout the United States, in honor
of the late President. The following Sermon was preached in St. Paul's
Chapel on that occasion.</p>

                  <p pn="6">"He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear
of God. And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun
riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing
out of the earth by clear shining after rain."-2 SAMUEL xxiii. 3,
4.</p>
               </epigraph>
               <p pn="6">THESE were the last words of David. He spake them as he saw
the time drawing near when he must go the way of all the earth; they
were the last song of the Psalmist. Each man knows best the law of his
own profession; he, as a ruler, knew what a ruler ought to be, and
delivered his judgment on that subject before he died. The sentence on
his own performances he left his Lord to utter; but the general law by
which he ought to have guided his course, he was moved so to state and
express in the moment in which the rod of empire was about to be taken
from his relaxing hand.</p>
               <p pn="6">Those words of David, the ancient king, may be most aptly
used as proper to a description of the dead President. We assemble
to-day on an occasion without a precedent in our past history. There
has been, on this side of the world, no sorrow like our sorrow, so far
as we can read back the history of the men who have dwelt
here. Regarded in its cause and in its manner of manifestation, it
stands beyond</p>

               <p pn="7">comparison in its awful grandeur. By that act, to which the sober
judgment of mankind has awarded the crown in degrees of atrocious
crime; by that deed, of which language fails to paint the infamy; by
that sin, against which Christian civilization cries out as involving
the reversal of all progress towards good, and as throwing back
mankind into the slough of barbarism, the act, the crime, the sin of
murderous assassination, a man has been laid low, who held in his
hands the destinies of twenty-five millions of his countrymen, and to
whom they were at that moment looking with growing confidence in his
honesty of purpose, his integrity of character, and his ability to do
his duty in that position unto which it had pleased God to call
him. And we are gathered together to mourn and weep with all those
millions over a bereavement which every lover of his country feels to
be personal to himself. There is a great cry throughout the land; it
seems as though there was not a house where there is not one
dead. Some few words would I reverently speak at this hour, when,
perhaps, a solemn silence might better suit the occasion.</p>
               <p pn="7">And first, of him who has been wrested from us by the
murderer's hand. That sanguinary fiend, that nocturnal demon of the
darkness of this world, thought to have done him a harm when he lifted
up the weapon against his life. How short-sighted are the calculations
of the wicked one! That act has been, not the destruction, but the
immortalizing of the venerated and beloved victim. When or where, at
any time, in any age, has a man gone to his grave as this ruler of the
land is going to his, this</p>

               <p pn="8">hour? Who ever saw or dreamed of a manifestation of sorrow, of
anguish, of interest, of devotion to one human being like that which
this hour is revealing? Unforced, unasked, the result of no national
edict, of no proclamation by authority, it is the simple, unaffected,
real demonstration of the heart of this great family of freemen. There
is a grandeur in this scene with which no occurrence hitherto can
compare. Let the bloodstained felon, wherever he be now skulking, mark
what he has done. He thought to spread dismay and confusion through
the land. He has but lifted a veil which lay upon the great national
heart, and shown the world its greatest strength and glory, in its
tenderness, its veneration for goodness, its magnificent collectedness
and self-control. His infamous deed has made stronger than ever the
people whom he hates; stronger, as they are stronger who have been
knit together by the bond of a common affliction. The sound of the
funeral hymn, now sternly ascending over the whole land, bespeaks a
compactness, a concentration, a mutual devotion, which, up to this
hour, lacked the lever of development and the cause of expression;
this funeral wail has in it the music of a coming era, through which
the dead of to-day shall walk in spirit, canonized and glorified in
the undying love and veneration of coming ages. Just as the French
look back to the good Henry IV., and love him for the fate which
brutal passion inflicted, so will the American people, to their
remotest generations, speak tenderly and reverently of that good, that
honest, that kindly-hearted man, their sixteenth President.</p>

               <p pn="9">"He that ruleth over man must be just, ruling in the fear of God."
How fairly do these words describe him. Who was just, if he was not?
or who, if we may read the man's inmost heart from his words, did ever
rule more conscientiously in the fear of God? Honesty and his name
were synonymous; and now that he is dead, what more could he ask, what
nobler record, than that he was proverbially the honest man? And then,
how tender-hearted; men thought at last almost too much so, but let us
rather think of that grand, Christ-like trait with thankfulness, that
it beamed forth so brightly from his person at the last. When they
struck him down he was meditating how to do them good; his last
official acts were acts of kindness and leniency, so marked as to
excite, in some quarters, alarm; in him they murdered their best
friend; his heart was full of plans of conciliation at the moment when
they aimed at it their execrable blow. That is enough for every lover
of peace to make him look, with moistened eyes, at that untimely
grave. There lieth one who, so far as we can judge, bore no ill-will
to any creature that lives; who, as he said himself when they told him
that he was reelected, felt sorry to triumph over any one; who was
seeking, in those his last few days, to find how he might soften to
the enemies of his country the circumstances of their late disastrous
defeats,--how he could save them mortification and humiliation,--how
much he could safely give them back of that which they had forfeited,
who would, I think, have pardoned, if it came to the last, even the
chief man of the insur-</p>

who, if he knew in those last hours what had happened to him, and who
had done it, would, I verily believe, have prayed for his murderer,
and been ready to do what no one else can do--forgive him. Oh, if
there be a crime more foul, more base, more abominable, than that
which has been done on that unostentatious, wise, kindhearted,
friendly man, let it be named, that we may see in the scale of
wickedness one degree below any yet known! The people know of nothing
worse, and, therefore, is he lamented as none was ever lamented for by
them unto this day.</p>
               <p pn="10">Whither can the assassin fly? Whither, that the justice of
Heaven shall not fell him? Whither, that the arm of the government
cannot lay hold of him? This is a case in which there need be no
impatience, no hurry. The retribution may be deferred; but it will
come. The whole earth has not a place where he cannot be known and
followed and found. The government does not exist which dare refuse to
give him up, if he be within its limits. Only one part of the world is
there to-day where he can breathe and walk abroad in safety--in those
parts of this country still in an insurgent condition, and not yet
reached by our armies. But around that lessening region the circle
hourly contracts. He shall not long have shelter there; the years at
last shall bring him into our hands, if the months and the days do not
do it sooner. There is small consolation in the thought; the evil
cannot be repaired. But that man owes a debt to the nation, and sooner
or later the hour of</p>

               <p pn="11">Among the thoughts which come upon the mind at such a
moment as this, is one of which I will briefly and dispassionately
speak. One consequence of this ghastly crime will be, and is already,
that an entire population is put on trial before the bar of the
opinion of mankind. It has been urged by many--by most--that this act
of assassination is but the natural result of a social condition to
which such acts seem properly to belong. It is said that the moral and
social tone, temper and spirit of the Southern people are such that
acts of infamy like this might naturally be expected from them. But
there are others who cannot consent to such a view of the case; who
claim for Southern civilization a higher tone, a better spirit; who
maintain that its principles are the principles of Christianity, and
that the moral condition of the people is not below that of the rest
of civilized mankind. To that opinion your preacher has adhered. He
could not feel that a whole people could have been so brutalized, so
degraded, as it has been represented that they are. But now the thing
is to be determined --the truth is to be made plain--in the red and
bloody light of this cruel and diabolical outrage. There can be no
escape from this test, nor any evasion of the issue. By the calm,
concurrent, and deliberate judgment of civilized and enlightened
nations, assassination is held to be a crime--an act which no
circumstances can excuse. That was not the Pagan view. The change in
opinion on this point has come with the</p>

His religion through the world. To defend assassination is no more
possible in this age than to defend suicide; no more possible on
Christian principles; it is classed among those frightful enormities
with which lower civilizations teem, and to which men are more or less
prone in proportion to their higher or lower position in the scale of
advancement. Hence we have heard, wherever this deed has been made
known beyond our borders, a cry of horror, a cry of detestation from
all official mouths--from all who could speak for constituencies. We
have heard that cry from those who have never been on our side, and
who do not yet alter their feelings concerning us; but as men, and as
Christians, they think it due to their manhood and their faith to
express, in language not to be misunderstood, their horror at the
sudden appearance of that barbarian shape, the political assassin,
amid the lights of this age. For two hundred and fifty-five years such
a dire shape has not emerged from the outer darkness to alarm and
astound the world. Since A. D. 1610, no ruling sovereign of a mighty
people has actually thus been hurried out of the world. Have we not,
therefore, in this event a test which no ingenuity can evade of the
real temper, tone, and quality of that community with which we have
been forced into contention? We wait to hear what they wil1 say. They
must speak, and the whole world wil1 listen to every word they
utter. He who invaded the family circle of the President and did him
to death; he who, with a dastardly cowardice which</p>

and helpless man, the Secretary of State, and stabbed him in his
bed,--these wretches knew not all that they did; for among the results
of those ferocious actions was this,--that they have arraigned the
whole Southern people before the bar of the opinion of mankind, and
put them on trial at that august tribunal. The judgment is set, and
the books are opened; Christian civilization waits attentively to hear
them speak. There is but one thing to do, if they would stand in this
audit. To denounce the act, to join in the common cry against the
outrage done to God, to man, to Christ, to the age; to disclaim any
responsibility for it; to shrink back from the bloody actors in that
murder; to say, We, too, are Christians, civilized beings, men; we
abhor as much as you can a deed like this; charge it not on us; it is
the work of desperadoes for whom we are not accountable: think not of
us as though we would excuse or defend a crime fit only for a
barbarous zone, and from which, with the enlightened world, and as
acceptors of the principles of Christianity, we equally with
yourselves revolt in disgust and horror. Such must be their answer, if
their claims be true. And would to God it might come back to us from
the other side in unmistakable terms,--a full, clear, hearty, manly
voice,--assuring us that the weapons of their warfare are and ever
will be those of honorable, though, as we deem, mistaken, men, and not
the poisoned chalice, the midnight torch, the secret dagger, the
muffled pistol. Then might good come even of this awful catas-</p>

murder, might yet join hands over his bloody grave, and ask
forgiveness of God and of each other in whatsoever, all through these
years, we have done amiss. Would to God it might be so; the blood of
the martyr might indeed make fertile the ground of that country, all
parts of which he loved. But I fear, I tremble lest it should be
otherwise, lest we shall hear some quite different voice, perhaps a
brutal cry of approval, perhaps a glorifying of the act even more
monstrous than the deed itself; for he who could calmly and in cold
blood justify it must be at heart like those who did it; and if that
sullen response should come, if those assassins should be received as
heroes, their crime applauded, their persons admired, the judgment of
mankind defied,--if such should be the answer, then, of a truth, must
the heart grow heavier than it is now, and a thoughtful man must ask
himself, "What are those people? What is their normal state? What are
their thoughts--their principles? What cause has been at work to keep
them back behind the rest of the world, to depress them, to hold them
at the old heathen positions, at the old standpoints of Paganism, to
keep them blind while all the rest of the world sees? What is that
civilization which appropriates and glories in deeds like this, which
calls the midnight murderer a hero, the stealthy killer of the old,
the sick, the defenceless, a demigod? Is it a work of this age? or is
it a thing of the past? Is it a system which rests on Gospel
principles and Christian ideas? or is it a remnant</p>

Brethren, it is with indescribable anxiety that many are now waiting
for the response of the Southern people to these atrocious murders
which have been committed in their name. We will not think the worst
until all hope is gone; we will yet hope against hope. But if it must
be so, then, indeed, will it seem as if all hope were at an end--as if
all that has been said were just--as if the charges hitherto made had
not been rash; and, so far as defence of that community is regarded,
impartial lips must be silent henceforth.</p>
               <p pn="15">A few words in conclusion. I return to my subject, to him
whose memory we honor today, for whom we make loud and bitter
lamentation. But he is beyond the reach of our cry; he is not,
however, beyond that of our praise. His name is with us--in our
households, on our national annals, on the roll of the world's
prominent men, and in the heart of a great nation while that nation
shall endure. I do not enumerate his amazing successes in guiding the
ship of state through as heavy a storm as ever beat and blew; in
leading us to conclusions of the most wonderful character, as official
commander-in chief of the power of the nation; in emancipating from
the fetters of slavery an entire race of human beings. Let the
historian write of all these things in his account of that remarkable
man. Let me rather repeat the</p>

in the fear of God:--For "he shall be as the light of the morning when
the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain." To him, with
wonderful accuracy, as we trust, may these words be applied. The
rebellion is nearly over; the sun of peace will soon, we trust, be
bright over all the land, and a new and grand era is commencing for
our country. But the good and honest President will ever stand there,
in the memory of the people, surrounded with the light of that morning
in which, just as it was rising upon us, he was called to his rest;
and his name will be, in the hearts of the American people, as green,
as fresh, and as pleasant as is to the eyes the tender grass springing
out of the earth by clear shining after the rain. Alas! that rain was
the rain of his own blood--the blood of his active brain, of his
generous heart; but there is already a great and clear shining upon
the earth where that red shower fell; and, while the lights of
martyrdom and sacrifice shall continue to shine, they will rest on
that venerable place, and glow there, like sacred fires, from
generation to generation.</p>
