            <p>CAMBRIDGEPORT, April 27, 1865.</p>
            <p>DEAR SIR,-- A general desire having been expressed by the
members of the Cambridgeport Parish, to preserve the discourse
delivered by you last Sunday, upon the mournful event which has
deprived a nation of the inestimable services of its dearly beloved
and warmly cherished chief magistrate, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, we ask of you
permission to have the same printed for distribution amongst the
members of the parish.</p>

            <p>GENTLEMEN, -- In answer to your favor of yesterday, I place
my manuscript at your disposal; knowing that I ought not to let my
feeling of its unworthiness defeat the wish of the parish to give some
expression to their grief at the nation's loss, and their feeling in
view of the late momentous events.</p>
            <p>I remain, gentlemen,
             <lb/>Cordially and respectfully,

                  <p>BEHOLD, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear!</p>
                  <p>O thou afflicted! tossed with tempest and not comforted,
behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy
foundations with sapphires.</p>
                  <p>And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.</p>
                  <p>And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great
shall be the peace of thy children.</p>
                  <p>In righteousness shall thou be established: thou shalt be
far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it
shall not come nigh thee.</p>
                  <p>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and
every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
condemn.</p>
                  <p>For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great
mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath, I hid my face from thee
for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee,

               <p>WHEN, three months ago, we followed to the grave the ashes of
Edward Everett, I took occasion to set before you the blessed life of
that peacemaker, our patriot scholar, as contrasted with the life of
him then chief of Confederate traitors, now baffled and beaten, an
outlaw and an exile.</p>
               <p>But what a new contrast is brought before our minds today!
What experiences press upon our hearts! How are our minds bewildered,
and our bosoms wrung! How unreal and visionary seems all our life, as
we are led thus through triumph and joy, with a constantly rising
pride and brightening hope,--the whole land full of gratulation and
glee;--till suddenly the cup is dashed from our hand, the crown from
our head,--every heart is made sick and faint, while our triumphs and
hopes are all forgotten in the one great trouble that broods in every
bosom!</p>
               <p>Never went a man to the grave, so loved and mourned as
Abraham Lincoln,--so followed by the tender sorrow of twenty millions
of his fellow-men. Never did man raise himself, in the brief space of
four years, from utter obscurity to a place of such honorable and
lasting fame, where he stood second to no ruler on earth in the love

admiration of his kind; and where he shall stand, as long as men keep
the record of the great and good, one of the most conspicuous and
noble figures in history.</p>
               <p>The nation mourns him, indeed, but not the nation
alone. Our nation will strive in vain to keep him as her own. Signal
as were his services to her, treasured as his memory will be, other
nations will claim to mingle their tears and praises with ours; his
deeds and his life so raise our estimate of human nature, so redound
to the glory and good of human kind. Considering his humble origin and
obscure life, till called suddenly, in such a momentous crisis, to
that great place, where the eyes of the whole anxious world were
concentrated upon him,--remembering the fearful labors demanded of
him, the awful responsibility imposed, the temptations he must meet,
the heart-breaking care when he must bear the sorrows of the whole
nation; the reproaches of foes, the bewildering, discordant counsels
of friends, the uncertainty of those providential leadings of events
which he must watch and interpret,--remembering his course, how he
watched and toiled and prayed; how he overcame evil with good; how he
was reviled, but reviled not again; suffered, but threatened
not,--recalling all his faithfulness as a public servant, his tact and
sagacity as an executive officer, his gentleness and true charity as
an enemy of his country's foes, his childlike simplicity and
genuineness, and, more than all, his thorough humility as a
victor,--never in any triumph, personal or official, no matter what
foes were at his feet,--not when triumphantly re-elected as Chief
Magistrate,--not when re-inaugurated mid the flush of victory,--not
when entering Richmond,--showing the slightest self-exaltation or
self-complacency; growing, indeed, more humble as he was more
exalted,--taking no glory to himself, but giving all the praise to his
subordinates, and

all the glory to God,--as we think of this more and more, we shall see
that Abraham Lincoln was one of the best men, and one of the most
extraordinary men, that God ever raised up to aid and encourage
mankind.</p>
               <p>Not <hi rend="italic">great</hi>, as the world judges; not
<hi rend="italic">learned</hi>; not of the most capacious intellect, or
most indomitable <hi rend="italic">will</hi>; not of great <hi rend="italic">experience</hi>, save in a comparatively humble
sphere,--he yet did a work, and has left a record, which might humble
great and learned men, and make conquerors and heroes ashamed. He was,
indeed, a conqueror and a hero of the <hi rend="italic">highest
type</hi>. Many have conquered <hi rend="italic">others</hi>, but he had
conquered himself; and he kept self conquered, when, in any other man,
the evil principle would have risen up again to mar the beautiful
consecration and completeness of his life.</p>
               <p>Not one man in many millions could have been raised from
comparative poverty and obscurity to such a place, to such a career,
to such success, and not been made giddy, and led to play some "
fantastic trick before high heaven to make the angels weep."</p>
               <p>Nor could one man in many millions have met so much
reviling and reproach,--been so ridiculed and traduced by foes without
and factions within,--yet kept so sweet and forgiving a spirit; been
so tender-hearted and merciful, while constantly upbraided as a
tyrant; been so ready to bless them that cursed him, to love his
enemies, to do good to them that hated him, to pray for them which
despitefully used him and persecuted him.</p>
               <p>This seems to me the most precious part of a memory whose
every part is fragrant, that you cannot point to an utterance of his,
nor recall a word or phrase, not full of pious humility and Christian
charity. There is absolutely nothing to forget, and nothing to
forgive. Whether he

spoke as a magistrate or as a man,--in messages, speeches, letters, or
private intercourse; whether speaking of foreign nations, of domestic
traitors, of an opposing political party, or of any officer or
citizen,--the country has yet to hear from him the word it now wishes
he could have left unsaid. And this humble, considerate charity was in
his <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> because it was in his <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>. It was not discretion, not guarded speech, not
a result consciously aimed at: he was a frank, natural, even blunt
man, who spoke what he thought. But he had in him, what David prayed
for, the clean heart and the right spirit. If ever a man's heart was
in the right place, his was; and his life could not but be beautiful,
when the fountain of it was so pure.</p>
               <p>Yet many a man, while right in spirit and purpose, finds
himself wrong in <hi rend="italic">deed</hi>, because of a weak judgment
or wavering <hi rend="italic">will</hi>. But how well the <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> of Abraham Lincoln answered to his <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>! He made few mistakes. His deeds were as good
as his words. Slow to decide, he almost always decided right. He was
sagacious, shrewd, and true. He looked into the hearts of other men as
he did into his own. Faithful with himself, he was faithful with
them. The young officer who came before him felt as in the presence of
a father, and received the counsel due to a son.</p>
               <p>A friend of mine, who had been unjustly dismissed from the
army, was re-instated on appealing to the ever-patient head of the
nation, whose task it was to undo the evil deeds others had done; but,
as the President restored to him his commission, perceiving the young
man's fault, he said kindly, and with a father's faithful rebuke, " I
<hi rend="italic">fear</hi>, my young friend, that you are <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">quarrelsome</hi>." and
when the young man, willing to justify himself, said

that that might not be so grave a fault in a <hi rend="italic">soldier</hi>, whose business was fighting, the President
rejoined, " No, sir: you are mistaken; I find that the quiet and
peaceable young men make the best officers and bravest soldiers."</p>
               <p>It was this kindly faithfulness that made him so dear to
the people as "FATHER ABRAHAM." They trusted to him as to a
father. They knew that he was diligent and conscientious, patient and
sincere. They saw his manly simplicity, his freedom from ostentation,
his sadness in adversity, his humility in success, his steadfast trust
in God, and his careworn face, as he bore all the people's sorrows on
his heart.</p>
               <p>They loved him: for they knew, by a thousand kind deeds and
words; by his messages to the widows and the children; by his patience
in hearing their petitions; by his eagerness to pardon offenders, when
justice and discipline would permit; by his anxious care to save them
suffering and suspense, as when he rode out himself, late one night,
or in the gray of the morning (you remember the incident), to bear the
reprieve to the poor soldier-boy, condemned to die at sunrise,--they
knew, by these thousand acts, and by the unerring instinct of their
own hearts, how <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> was his love for
them,--not the love of the politician, but of the faithful public
servant and the father of his people. They knew him to be, in the best
sense of the word, a man and a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>; yes, as
Tennyson says,--</p>
               <lg type="stanza">

ignoble use!"</l>
               </lg>

charitable and humble in spirit; one of the most successful rulers and
admirable men to whom an admiring people ever looked up. Who can fail
to see the hand of Providence in raising up such a ruler for our
people, in such a time as this? and who can fail to see the ground we
have for thanksgiving, in that this national calamity was deferred
till his great service was rendered to us, and till the glory of
success was secured to him?</p>
               <p>Had he been assassinated four years ago,--and there is not
a man of us but expected it then,--how different might our career have
been! or, had he fallen on the last fourth of March,--and many of us
expected it then,--how much had even then been wanting to his joy and
the completeness of his life! He lived to complete the great task he
proposed to himself, when he first so quietly called the nation to
arms. Then he took his place, scorned, hated, despised,--the long-spun
toils of the traitors entangling all about his feet,--his own powers
and the endurance of the nation alike untried. He lived to "hold,
occupy, and possess" all those national posts whence the flag had been
so ignominiously torn down. He lived to live down all the shameless
calumny and reproach at home and abroad. He lived to see the world
come round to his view, appreciate his character, and endorse his
policy. He lived to hear the Charleston "Mercury" wish that Jefferson
Davis were as wise and good as he. He lived to conquer the malice of
foes, to win the respect of the world, and the appreciative love of a
people proud to call him their own. He lived to vindicate republican
institutions, himself their noblest product; to be the saviour of his
country, the liberator of four million slaves; to be a peerless
conqueror, both in the Council chamber and in the field; and at last,
when success had set the approving seal of Providence on his

purposes, policy, and plans,--when the Father of Waters rolled unvexed
to the sea, --when Savannah, Charleston, Wilmington, Mobile, and
Richmond felt the foot of liberty on their rebellious necks, --when
the crafty and insolent head of the Rebellion was a despairing
fugitive, and its red right hand was stretched out to sue for peace,
--when Libby Prison had changed inmates, and was full of rebel
soldiers and traitor-citizens, --when, in Richmond, Abraham Lincoln
had had such a triumph as no man ever had before, receiving the
blessing of them ready to perish, hearing the freedmen sing there
their songs of jubilee, --and when, at the very last, the sun of that
Good Friday, when he died, had seen the old flag set back again on
Sumter's wall, and the <hi rend="italic">nation's vow was fulfilled
before God</hi>, --well might he have lifted up his hands in joyful
submission to exclaim, " Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation!"</p>
               <p>That triumphal entry into Richmond was glory enough for one mortal
to possess. We have all seen a familiar picture of Washington's entry
into Trenton, --matron and maid strewing roses before his charger's
feet; but what was <hi rend="italic">that</hi> triumph, what was any
triumph the world ever saw, save the humble entry of Jesus into
Jerusalem, compared with that entry into Richmond when Freedom
triumphed, while slavery and treason fled away, --when the emancipator
of millions walked in triumph; not with the uplifted head of human
pride and exultation; not with captive queens marching before him in
chains of gold; not with captured banners and the spoil of cities
pompously displayed; not with the trumpet's blare, and herald's

mid that praying, weeping multitude of freedmen, showering prayers and
blessings on his head,-- where he walked, the humblest of them all,
yet emancipator and conqueror,--already with the martyr's halo round
his brow; and where there went in with him Liberty and Union, one and
inseparable <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, now and for ever!</p>
               <p>That was a scene which will live in history; and this was
glory enough for one mortal to possess.</p>
               <p>Though we mourn for him all the more sadly because of our
success; though we wish he could have been spared to see the results
of his great labors and cares, and to live, as Washington did, midst a
grateful people,--yet the country feels that there was a wonderful
completeness in his life, and, if violent death is ever timely, a
timeliness in his death.</p>
               <p>Our hearts say to him, in trustful sorrow,--</p>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>"Go to the grave, in all thy glorious prime,</l>
                  <l>In full
maturity of zeal and power:</l>
                  <l>A Christian cannot die before his
time,--</l>
                  <l>The Lord's appointment is the servant's hour.</l>

                  <l>Come from the heat of battle;

               <p>Yet, while the nation feels thus trustful and hopeful, who
can foresee the result of the assassin's crime?</p>
               <p>It would be interesting to consider the assassinations of
history, their motives and consequences.</p>
               <p>But, for the honor of human nature, so dignified and
adorned by Mr. Lincoln's life and character, I cannot but believe that
his assassin is of unsound mind. The fact that his father was insane
before him, long before quitting the stage; the incoherent letters
left by this assassin, genu-

ine, but obviously those of an insane man; the long brooding over this
crime, and open boasting of his purpose; the audacity and theatrical
show of its execution, and the very craft of his escape and
concealment; the impossibility of any good resulting to a cause
already lost,--the absence of any adequate motive, even revenge or the
love of notoriety,--convince me that he is a man of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>Yet, as has well been said, slavery is both the child and
parent of barbarism; assassination, its only fit expression. And he
was not insane who assaulted the Secretary of State, striving to
murder a helpless old man in his bed, his arm already broken. He was
not insane who crept up behind a senator, fettered in his seat. They
were not insane who kept Andersonville, and took Fort Pillow. They
were not insane who, in communication with Richmond, co-operated with
these assassins.</p>
               <p>We used to complain of slavery, that it fostered duelling;
but the duellist who confronts his foe like a man, sees him armed like
himself, gives him due notice, and an equal chance for his life; the
duellist is a gentleman and a Christian compared with the assassin,
whose deed concentrates all crimes; and, when directed against the
head of the nation, becomes treason, treachery, cowardice, and murder,
all in one, and is a fit expression of that nurse of brutality, which
has poisoned our moral life, deluged the land in blood, given us Libby
Prison and Andersonville, and added this crowning horror to its
crimes.</p>
               <p>If the murderer was insane, those who aided and urged him
on were not; and his deed was the fitting, may it prove the <hi rend="italic">final</hi>, manifestation of slavery!</p>
               <p>But the country leaps with amazing promptness to the
conclusion, that God will overrule this calamity to our

good. Indeed, even in the midst of our grief, some do injustice to the
dead, by claiming that we needed now a juster and firmer hand upon the
helm. A juster, firmer, steadier hand upon that helm, we shall never
see. And we wait in trembling hope to see whether another can show
such consecration of purpose, such forgetfulness of past injury, such
elevation of spirit, such devotedness and discretion, as to win the
confidence of the people, banish their present fear, and not prolong
or revive their regret. If there was any need of a juster, firmer
spirit anywhere, it was not in the bosom of the President, but in the
hearts of the people. It was not <hi rend="italic">he</hi> that counted
treason no crime. He was merciful; he was prompt to forgive; his
delight was to pardon, to remit penalty, to modify extreme measures:
but he was <hi rend="italic">just</hi>, and he was <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>. He knew that justice to traitors is mercy to
mankind. The convening of the rebel legislature in Richmond, after its
capture, was no deed of his; the attempt to treat with a State, as
though the State had seceded or been in rebellion, was no mistake of
his.  His will ordered that rebel legislature away, or into prison.
And the only fear or peril was, not that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would
be too gentle, but that the people, overjoyed with victory and peace,
would not sustain his hands, and permit him to be <hi rend="italic">just</hi>.</p>
               <p>This was a grave peril, on whose brink we stood. The rebel
Commander-in-Chief was a prisoner of war,--a beaten traitor, liable at
any moment to the pains and penalties of treason; liable at any moment
to be released from his parole, and brought before a jury of his
peers, and sent to the scaffold as one who had violently attempted his
Country's life, and whose hands were red with the blood of a hundred
thousand of our brothers and sons.</p>

               <p>But the people, happy with victory and the promise of
peace, upbraided Jefferson Davis, yet lauded Robert Lee, and were
ready to receive him with a hero's honors, instead of a traitor's
infamy. The army, part of it, would sooner have followed him, as joint
commander with our Lieutenant General, on an expedition into Canada or
Mexico, than have escorted him to the scaffold. That feeling lingers
still. Because he was so long successful in Virginia, and had made it
all one great battle-field, red from end to end with patriot blood,
men attributed all the infamy to the rebel president, but all the
success to the rebel general, the red right hand of the rebellion.</p>
               <p>The nation had virtually pardoned him and his army, and
were ready to make his red hands white with the kisses of their
forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Individuals cried out against it. Mourning households
protested against it, as an outrage on the memory of their patriot
dead. They whose hearts lie buried at Antietam or Gettysburg; who weep
over Malvern Hill or Fair Oaks; whose kindred lie in the Wilderness or
at Manassas, at Winchester or Harper's Ferry, by Fredericksburg or
along the James, at Petersburg, yes, or in the nameless graves at
Richmond; they whose brothers and sons languished mid the horrors of
Andersonville, and came thence rotting skeletons or drivelling idiots,
or came thence, alas! no more,--these all protested against such
unseasonable mercy to traitors, as unfaithfulness to our country's
future, and to the memory of our dead. But our countrymen were not all
mourners: many households had been untouched. Something was needed to
bring this distributed grief to the heart of every man and woman in
the land; and God permitted that assassination;-- </p>

               <p>We are <hi rend="italic">one party now</hi>. We are <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
mourners. There is not a loyal eye that has not been wet with sorrow,
nor a loyal household which has not lost a friend. The great sacrifice
of the land is typified now in him. A few will remember Andersonville,
a few wil1 remember Gettysburg; but <hi rend="italic">all</hi> will
remember Abraham Lincoln, and swear by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> memory
that the memory of our other martyrs shall never be disgraced!</p>
               <p>Friends, our strife is by no means over: though we may hope
that the great battles are all fought, our perils are far from
past. Some of our severest trials lie in our immediate future. And it
seems as though Mr. Lincoln must die, that his spirit might be more
efficient in our counsels, guiding us aright. The land is full of
prowling treachery and possible assassins. No officer's life is safe
for a day. To be just, but not vindictive; to punish, not for revenge,
but for future security; to know when mercy is wisdom, and when it is
criminal weakness,--was never so desirable or so difficult as now. It
was expedient that he should go away, that he might be more
effectively with us in these days of trial.</p>
               <p>And if his fall unite us as one stricken household, and
nerve the nation's hand for those necessary tasks which victory makes
all the more painful to us; if it evoke the horror of all civilized
nations, illustrating anew the odious spirit of slavery; if he stand
as the one great symbol of all the fearful sacrifices the country has
made, not to be forgotten or put aside; and if, looking to him, the
nation goes on now to finish its great task with the same amazing
unanimity with which, four years ago, we began it,--we shall see that
he both lived and died for our country; and that, as Tacitus says of
Agricola, he was happy, not only in the splendor of his life, but also
in the opportuneness of his death.</p>

               <p>Nor let us feel that his eyes can no longer see the
redemption or the future glory of the land. We wish that he had lived
to see peace, and the wonderful revival of energy and hope which peace
will bring. We wish that he could have lived to see fifty millions of
people--as some here present will see a hundred millions of
people--living in this happy land of freedom, and looking up to the
one proud flag. But we wish the same for the hundreds of thousands of
our loyal dead, lying in their nameless graves, scattered throughout
all the land, each as much of a martyr as he. We wish they could have
lived to see even the happy days of victory he saw, instead of dying
in hours of discouragement and gloom, when the nation's heart was
faint, and her hope was dim.</p>
               <p>Ah! let us not think but that they do see these days of
chastened joy; and that he sees, with clearer eyes than ours, what is,
and what is to be. Let us not think but that those hosts of martyrs
have gathered about our lost leader, and that there have been heavenly
greetings between these and the patriots of an earlier day,--the
Father of our Country welcoming that country's Saviour. We rest in
that providence of God, and that blessed hope of the Immortal Life.</p>

bright, the bird-songs rang so cheerily; while, mid bursting buds and
laughing waters, the springtime, tinting the tree-tops and unrolling
her living green along the meadows, set her glowing footprints
steadfastly toward the North. It seemed as though Heaven mocked at our
human grief But, at last, the peace and calmness of nature stole into
my heart, as I thought of that steadfast
